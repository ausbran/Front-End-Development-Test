# Front-End-Development-Test
This is a front end development test, specifically geared to test abilities in semantics, styles and scripts as they relate to User Interface & User Experience design.

## Assets
#### The following has been provided within this repository:

1. **“assets” folder** - This folder includes the **majority** of image, video and font files that will be needed.
2. **“psd” folder** - This folder includes a Photoshop document of the design. The file is intentionally unorganized and mesnt to be difficult to find layers.
3. **“jpg” folder** - This folder includes a JPG of the design.
4. **“mp4” folder** - This folder includes a 20 second animation. The animation is a representation of the intended functionality for the design.

## Objectives/Requirements
1. Use HTML5, or HAML if preferred.
2. Use a CSS preprocessor for styles, SCSS or Sass.
3. Use whatever Javascript libraries you would like. The less, the better.
4. Refer to the image below to see how the intended final product should appear in a browser. The image below also specifies breakpoints and device limitations.
